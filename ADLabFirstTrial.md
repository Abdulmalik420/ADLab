# ADLab First Trial
- At first I tried to do this lab by using vagrant and managing the the vm using that but it didn't workout.
- From the research that I have done it seams like it good to have two network adapters for the main machine. One a NAT so it can connect to the internet and another internal network for the other machines that are going to be managed by the AD of the main machine.
