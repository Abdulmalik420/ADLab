# Challenge
- In this challenge I will be adding a vm that has a linux OS into the domain.
### Walk Through
- We need to create a vm like we did with the windows user that we had created. I will be using [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Its the one with all the basic things that I might need.
- While creating the VM we need to add it to our internal network.
